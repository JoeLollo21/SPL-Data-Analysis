By early April, the region may see 25,000 people infected if no actions are taken. To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, The Seattle Public Library will close all Library locations. Except for preschool programs and hygiene services, Seattle Parks and Recreation will cancel all programming, rentals, and permitted events, and close all community centers, pools, environmental learning centers, and all other recreation facilities to the public.},
