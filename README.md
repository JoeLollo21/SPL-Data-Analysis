# Viral Literature
Projects for my research assistantship with [Dr. Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/) at UW in Winter 2023.

Resources include:
- [*Tweets of a Native Son*](http://tweetsofanativeson.com/), created by Dr. Walsh when she was a Ph.D. student.
- TWARC, a Jupyter Notebook/Python package for working with the Twitter API.
